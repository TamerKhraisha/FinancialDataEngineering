## Launch the Docker container

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the 

   `/path/to/repo/conferences/DSC2024`


2. Make sure that Docker is running on your machine

   The operating-system independent way to check whether Docker is running is to ask Docker, using the `docker info` command.
   The docker info command checks whether Docker is running by querying the Docker daemon for information. If the daemon is active, it returns system information. If itâ€™s not running, the command fails, indicating that Docker isn't operational. This provides an OS-independent way to verify if Docker is running since it directly communicates with the Docker daemon, regardless of the underlying operating system.


3. Build the image by running the following command

   `docker build -t financial-apis .`


4. Start the container with the command

   `docker run -p 8888:8888 -v ./scripts:/project/scripts  financial-apis`


5. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab`
